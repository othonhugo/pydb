**pydb** is an educational project focused on learning the internal concepts and fundamentals of a database system. The goal is not to create a commercial product, but rather to demystify what happens "under the hood" in systems like PostgreSQL, Redis, or MongoDB by building a simplified version from scratch.

This project is designed for students and software enthusiasts who want to deepen their knowledge of data structures, algorithms, I/O operations, and system architecture.

## Project Goals

- **Educational Focus**: Understand core database concepts through hands-on implementation
- **Simplified Architecture**: Build a working database system with essential components
- **Learning by Doing**: Explore storage engines, query processing, indexing, and transaction management
- **Foundation Building**: Gain insights into how production databases work internally

## Features

The project is actively being developed with the following components:

- **Storage Engine**: Mechanisms for data persistence and retrieval
- **Query Processing**: Parsing and executing database operations
- **Indexing**: Data structures for efficient data access
- **Transaction Management**: Ensuring data consistency and integrity
- **Concurrency Control**: Handling multiple simultaneous operations
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Data durability and crash recovery

## Learning Objectives

By exploring this project, you will gain understanding of:

- Low-level data storage and file I/O operations
- Memory management and buffer pooling
- B-tree and other indexing structures
- Query optimization techniques
- ACID properties implementation
- Concurrency control mechanisms (locking, MVCC)
- Write-ahead logging and recovery protocols

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Development Tools**: pylint, mypy, black, isort
- **Testing**: pytest

## Documentation

Additional documentation can be found in the `docs/` directory, including:

- Architecture decisions and design patterns
- Implementation notes and development backlog
- Technical references and learning resources
